    <p>But on my own code learning journey this webpage represents a bit of technical milestone for me as I put the whole thing together with a command line and a keyboard, no windows, no menus, no mouse :-)</p>

    <p>I installed Ubuntu LTS 16.04 then complied Node and Express from source, and that’s what I using to serve this page to you now</p>
    <p>The page itself will be evolving quickly as I progress through <a href=’https://bloc.io’ target=’_blank’>Bloc’s</a> Full Stack Web Dev curriculum, and will eventually turn into my personal blog and a portfolio of my completed projects and freelance work.  But for the time being you may see some odd features that make no sense, but that's just me playing with new tools and concepts while I hone my skills</p>

    <p>I thought this article was helpful to me as a Windows user to help ease me back in to the Linux/CLI I learned many years ago:<a href='https://char.gd/blog/2017/how-to-set-up-the-perfect-modern-dev-environment-on-windows'> How to set up the perfect modern dev environment on Windows</a></p>
    <p>This was also very helpful in helping me get my HTTP server running, though it is a bit out of date when it comes to using upstart instead of system to run it as a service: <a href=’ http://seanvbaker.com/setting-up-a-node-website/’ target=’_blank’>The Node Den - Setting Up a Node.js Website</a></p>
